Installation instructions for VHDocL
=====================================

Considering you are reading this, you have already downloaded the tar archive
containing a release of VHDocL.  Just for the record, the home page of VHDocL
is http://www.volkerschatz.com/hardware/vhdocl.html.


Prerequisites / dependencies
----------------------------

VHDocL is a Perl script, so you need to have Perl installed.  Linux
distributions provide packages containing the Perl interpreter and standard
modules, which can be installed with the distribution's package manager.  For
Windows, you can download Active Perl
(http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/) or one of the other Perl
distributions for Windows (see
http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Win32_Distributions).

VHDocL also needs some Perl modules.  Most of them are quite common, so they
may already have been installed together with Perl itself.  Under Linux, you
can check their presence with the command "perldoc File::Path", for example.

The required packages and their CPAN homepages are:

Cwd and File::Spec   http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/PathTools/
File::Path           http://search.cpan.org/~dland/File-Path/
Digest::MD5          http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/Digest-MD5/
File::Copy           (included in Perl distribution)
Time::HiRes (for --benchmark only)  http://search.cpan.org/~zefram/Time-HiRes/

Under Linux, distribution packages should be available for all of them; otherwise you may have to use the "cpan" or "cpanp" utility.  The easiest way to install
them under Windows is using the package manager of the Perl distribution if it
provides one.  Otherwise you have to download them from their CPAN homepages
and install them manually.


Installing VHDocL
------------------

The archive of VHDocL contains an installer, the Perl script
"install-vhdocl.pl".  It works for both Linux and Windows, but there are some
differences.  It has the following options:

-h  Print brief usage message
-n  Runs the installer without actually installing anything, but prints all the
    installation paths and messages as usual

Installing on Linux
--------------------

For Linux it is sufficient to run "install-vhdocl.pl" without options.  The
executable is then installed in /usr/local/bin, and other stuff in
corresponding directories under /usr/local.  If /usr/local/bin is already in
your PATH, no further action is necessary.

If you want, you can choose a different installation directory (instead of
/usr/local) or data directory (for HTML style data; see "install-vhdocl.pl -h"
for how to do it).  In the latter case, you need to set the environment
variable VHDOCL_DATADIR to that directory before using VHDocL.  (It makes sense
to add that assignment to the system's global bashrc file.)  And of course the
directory in which the executable is going to be located has to be in your PATH
if you want to run it without an explicit path.

Installing on Windows
----------------------

On Windows there is no default installation directory, so it always has to
be given on the command line of the installer.  The data directory defaults to
the "data" subdirectory of the installation directory.  The executable is
installed both under its plain name and with the extension .pl, so the command
"vhdocl.pl" automatically invokes the Perl interpreter if file associations are
set correctly.  The environment variable VHDOCL_DATADIR has to be set always,
best once and for all in the global system variables list.  The installer
reminds you of this.

In order to use VHDocL comfortably, you should add the installation directory
(which is also the location of the executable) to the global PATH variable.
This saves you always giving the path when running the command.
