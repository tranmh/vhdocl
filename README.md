# VHDocL

VHDocL is a structural documentation tool for the hardware description language
VHDL, similar to doxygen, javadoc and others for software languages.  It
documents packages and package bodies; entities with their ports and generics;
architectures and their instantiations, processes and generate statements; and
much more.  It outputs interlinked HTML pages of entity and package lists, the
instantiation hierarchy, all design elements (entities, packages, ...) and
source files converted to HTML with syntax markup.

The upstream repository of VHDocL is not hosted on github, but on the author's
web site: <http://volkerschatz.com/hardware/vhdocl.html>.  Volker is
old-fashioned and believes git is a distributed RCS that works quite well
without a hub.  But he wrote this README.md as a template for folks who want to
store a branch on github.


# This fork

Intended to have a copy of Volkers version for better collaboration with other
developers.
