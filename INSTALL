Instructions for installing VHDocL from the git repository
===========================================================

If you are reading this, you have already successfully cloned the git
repository from http://volkerschatz.com/repositories/vhdocl.  Congratulations.

The Perl script "install-from-git.pl" in the top directory prepares the install
by copying the development versions of VHDocL and its .pod documentation to the
distribution directory and then runs the conventional install script there
(vhdocl-dist/install-vhdocl.pl).  "install-from-git.pl" takes the same options
as that installer and passes its command line on unchanged.  The -h option
prints brief documentation.  See also vhdocl-dist/INSTALL.

If you want to package and distribute an intermediate (non-release) version, be
it the newest development version or an older one, you can use the shell script
"mkvhdocldist.sh" to create a package tarball.
